# base.find_site

## 1.2.0
- Tiger fallback: timeouts, protective statuses (403/429/503/52x) and JavaScript shells are re-tried in a real browser with up to 10 s to settle. Domains that do not resolve never go to Tiger.
- Sites still showing an interactive human check are returned as `blocked_by_check`, never solved.

## 1.1.0
- Tervory's own search (SearXNG) between the verified hint and Brave. Site root is what gets verified.
- A page must contain ALL distinctive name words (generic words like firearms/guns/supply ignored), not any one.

## 1.0.0
- First version. Verified hint > Brave search (if key) > domain guess.
- final URL without trailing slash; initials guess removed; domain guesses must mention the business name on the page.
