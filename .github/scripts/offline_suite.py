"""Run the whole offline test suite, in parallel, the way the PR tank job does.

  python3 .github/scripts/offline_suite.py [extra pytest args]

Offline means: no provider keys in the environment, and in-process sockets
may only reach loopback (pytest-socket). The Postgres service, a local Redis
container started by tests/tenant_bus, Chromium and Node all run on the runner.

Three pytest runs, because two test folders import sibling modules by bare
name (test_alerts, test_review) and so cannot share one process with other
folders that have files of the same name:
  1. everything else, 2. tests/tiger_g5, 3. tests/zenas_regulation_alerts.
tests/ci_security runs in the security job (it needs the pinned gitleaks),
tests/test_live_check.py in live-check.yml and tests/test_signed_in_runner.py in
signed-in-check.yml (both need Playwright for Node).
The files in SIDE_WORKFLOW run in rig-forge.yml or tenant-rls.yml, not here.

Known failures on main are listed with reasons in tests/quarantine.txt.

Fail fast (ci run 41241674166, 31 Oct 2026: worker gw0 died in
tests/test_rig_landing_overflow.py at 21:17:42 UTC and the job then sat silent
until the 30-minute job timeout cancelled it at 21:32:44 UTC, with no stack):
  - faulthandler_timeout prints every thread's stack for a test still running
    after 240s, before the 300s per-test timeout kills its worker;
  - --max-worker-restart 0 ends a run as soon as a worker crashes, instead of
    replacing the worker and re-running the same file;
  - each run has a wall-clock budget; past it, the whole process group gets
    SIGABRT (pytest's faulthandler prints the stacks) and then SIGKILL, so the
    step fails with evidence well before the job timeout.
