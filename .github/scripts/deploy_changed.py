"""Deploy only the Coolify apps whose code changed in a push to main.

Runs after CI passes on main. Reads the changed paths between BEFORE and AFTER,
maps them to Coolify app names, looks up each app's uuid by name through the
Coolify API, and queues a deploy. The main app goes first and must finish with
success. The South Africa stack (tervory-tank-za) is next and must finish
before any room is deployed, so a broken main or SA deploy never fans out.
The token comes from COOLIFY_TOKEN and is never printed.

Images (9 Nov): with DEPLOY_PLAN set (deploy-on-merge, after its build job), an app whose
images this run built gets them promoted to :live just before its Coolify deploy, so Coolify
only pulls and restarts; a failed deploy or health check puts :live back and redeploys the
old images; DEPLOY_RECORD keeps the previous digests of every app for a one-step rollback
(`deploy_changed.py rollback`, coolify-ops op=rollback). See deploy_images.py.
