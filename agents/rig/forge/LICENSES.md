# Forge software and licences

The image retains upstream notices. Source links below identify corresponding
upstream source; the lock manifests identify the exact downloaded bytes. Blender
is invoked as a separate executable, never imported or linked into this service.

The default TRELLIS background remover, RMBG-2.0, is **not included or fetched**.
Prepared images are composited on a neutral matte. DINOv3 weights must already be
lawfully available to the operator; the GPU image build verifies the provided
offline bundle. It does not request another service, credential or paid model.

Python dependencies (including NumPy, VTK, FastAPI, boto3 and the Hugging Face SDK)
are pinned with upstream PyPI SHA256 in `requirements.lock`; Node dependencies
are pinned with npm integrity metadata in `package-lock.json`. Their installed
distributions retain their own licence files.

## Checksum provenance

- Blender, gltfpack and KTX use published upstream SHA256; Python artifacts use
  upstream PyPI SHA256, enforced with `--require-hashes`.
- npm publishes SHA512 for the CLI and validator. The installer verifies that
  published value **and** the computed SHA256 recorded in `tools.lock.json`.
- Meshroom publishes the release size but no digest. The official release was
  downloaded over verified HTTPS, its size checked, and its SHA256 pinned.
- GitHub/GitLab source archives have published commit IDs and no archive SHA256.
  Every archive, including git submodules, was downloaded over verified HTTPS
  and given a SHA256 in `gpu/sources.lock.json`.
- Model LFS files use upstream SHA256; small files use the published Git blob
  SHA1 plus SHA256 where publicly downloadable. `prepare_models.py` verifies the
  licensed bundle and records a SHA256 for **every** file in the built image
  before adjusting the local pipeline configuration.

These fallbacks follow the founder's approved hash policy; a computed digest is
not described as an independently published upstream SHA256.
